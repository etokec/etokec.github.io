Coucou!

I am passionate about making information accessible to everyone. I leverage my knowledge in quantitative analysis to help on a volunteer basis non-profit organizations gains a better understanding of their data and to empower my community.
I like basketball, afrofuturism and tasting new dishes all over the Bay Area.  
Thoughts and opinion are my own.
