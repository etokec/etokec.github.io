XRStudio is a futuristic studio space providing mentorship, collaboration and equipment for 30 women to develop work in machine learning and mixed reality in San Francisco from May to November 2018.

I had an amazing time during the XRStudio. My focus was on gaining exposure to AR/VR technologies and Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to the studio I was able to connect with an amazing and badass group of creative women in technology and felt a level of support that is so rare in this field. I am deeply grateful to Mozilla and the organizers and sponsors (Ann-Caryn and Mariam) for curating this wonderful experience.
